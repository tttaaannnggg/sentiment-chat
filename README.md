# sentiment-chat
[I'm blogging through the process and my decision making here](https://dev.to/tttaaannnggg/initial-planning-for-sentiment-chat-4e05)

Sentiment Chat is an experimental chat project.

You'll be able to enter a chatroom and send and receive messages. **but**, you won't be able to see the words that you receive from others. Instead, you'll see a color for each message they send you. This color will correspond to the results of a sentiment analysis library. You'll be able to see your own words, but not know exactly what color you're sending the other person.

At some point, you'll be able to end a chat, and you'll receive back a chat log that combines the color of each message and its actual text. You'll see what both sides were saying, and what both sides were saying.

More to come as I continue to develop.
